The only option seems to follow is use custom contract type eg.\nnew_contract('valid_name', lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0)\n@contract(names='dict(int: (valid_name, int))')\ndef process_accounting(records):\n    ...\n\nThe problem occurring over here is the function name provided to the new_contract method gets the value of the argument implicitly as the one and only argument. Since this doesn't even receive the self or any other kind of variable its impossible to access other objects from inside this method which means we can't populate a class for storing metadata of the acceptable set of values and unless we modify contracts itself or define the acceptable set of values in the function itself. When defining the acceptable values in the function itself it is impossible to access those values outside the method thus defeating the purpose. contracts also follows a strict syntax which makes it impossible to predefine a custom set of methods for each kind of setting in the base classes to which the actual bear can just pass the acceptable values and the setting list to compare against. Everything needs to be implemented in each bear itself. Summing up things like\n[new_contract(i, lambda s: isinstance(s, str) and len(s)>0) for i in in setting_list]\n\nalso doesn't work which makes the code much more difficult to read. The usage of contracts module also provides difficulty when the some default values of the bear setting are assumed in case of the value to the setting is not provided or invalid value is given.\nUsing Type hints provided by python\nThese are pretty much worthless. They can be only used for documentation purposes unless the type checking is performed specially with loading the mypy module which just checks for type hint inconsistencies and doesn't actually run the program. (Haven't tested this out with custom classes). Normal runs of the code don't point out any inconsistencies in invalid types according to type hints.\nWriting code and manual checks for each setting in some way or the other\nThis should be the last resort unless an elegant way is devised. Can be done using decorators or the bear code is itself but a common set of classnames have to be come upon which will be used by all the bears to extract out information about these settings. This can be performed by adding classes to the base class and asking the bear writers to fill them up. Functions can also be made in the base classes to test out settings to automatically provide just the setting and the default values, calling the correct function for the correct setting type and checking whether the value provided is valid or not.","comments":16,"createdAt":"2018-06-10T06:59:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-11T05:42:56Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"ishanSrt","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29859362?v=4"},"labels":[]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1534394227000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2304","number":2304,"title":"GitCommitBearTest.py : Typo in line 50","body":"There's a typo at https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/blob/master/tests/vcs/git/GitCommitBearTest.py#L50\nmessgae -> message","comments":5,"createdAt":"2018-03-03T17:52:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-16T04:37:07Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"codeKAMAT","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/36402247?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"c5def5"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1532546229000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2389","number":2389,"title":".coafile: Ignore *.orig in ci section","body":"Current implementation performs analysis on .orig files as well.\ndifficulty/newcomer","comments":11,"createdAt":"2018-03-30T15:53:21Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-25T19:17:09Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"MacBox7","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15063552?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"MacBox7","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15063552?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"gutsytechster","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31796326?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1532640887000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2437","number":2437,"title":"PEP8Bear: Change the docstring indentation.","body":"difficulty/newcomer","comments":10,"createdAt":"2018-04-15T06:38:39Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-26T21:34:47Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"newbazz","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25884863?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"newbazz","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25884863?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"vaibhav9619","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/35555074?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/documentation","color":"c5def5"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1532462007000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2453","number":2453,"title":"CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX hack for travis is not required anymore","body":".travis.yml sets CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX=-1 to avoid being a circle worker\nRemove code related to this hack as pip deps are no more called from travis","comments":2,"createdAt":"2018-04-26T16:47:58Z","updatedAt":"2018-07-24T19:53:27Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"harshhx17","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/31805694?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"harshhx17","avatarUrl":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/31805694?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"area/ci","color":"d93f0b"},{"name":"difficulty/newcomer","color":"65C8FF"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"70e870"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"coala-bears","updatedAtMs":1534436530000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2062","number":2062,"title":"JSONFormatBear complains about number representation","body":"Let's say I have a file test.json for a simulation I'm running,\n{\n    \"expansion-coefficient\": 23.4e-6\n}\nNow, when I run coala -b JSONFormatBear --files=test.json, it wants to change the number to 2.34e-05, which is of course mathematically equivalent.

The mapping isnt exact, but the benefits of using the test result format is tight integration with various system.\nCircleCI can accept this format: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/\nAppVeyor can receive a test results XML format, in the format output by xunit, presumably the same as JUnit.\nhttps://www.appveyor.com/docs/running-tests/#uploading-xml-test-results\nThe first project phase could involve converting the JSON to JUnit format and uploading into Circle CI and Appveyor.\nThe JUnit format should also be tested with a Jenkins install, to ensure it is uploading correctly there.  This would mean our Jenkins project is much less important.\nAnother common format is TAP.\nAnd there is Clover XML format.\nThen there are some system, such as Phabricator, which have a custom format they expect.\nc.f. facebook/infer#673\nThe above probably doesnt fill 3 months.\nPulling the coala results from CI using this format could be a way to inform newbies of the style problems with their PRs.\nAnother way to expand this project is to also push the unit test results as XML to the CI (using combination XML files if necessary)","comments":3,"createdAt":"2018-04-17T11:07:57Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-10T16:21:54Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1533284698000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/564","number":564,"title":"Split repology project into two projects","body":"We have two different projects both utilising Repology for installation.\nAnd there is only one repology project here: https://github.com/coala/projects/blob/master/_projects/automate_dependacy_repology.md\nAlso relevant is the cib project, which will also be improving our dependency management, but it will be fixing an end-user tool, and will likely be trying to leverage conda to help get the dependencies installed.\nAs a result, the cib project will inevitable be solving the pip dependencies.\nThe 'Go on BSD' project is clearly about Go, and only Go.  The meat of this project is supporting lots of versions of Go, and different BSD, and possible also other more obscure OS like Alpine Linux.\nThe current repology project is about getting 'all' linters linked to Repology.\nI suspect the timeline is not allowing enough time for the process of creating Repology packages for linters that are not yet in Repology, and it seems large numbers of them are missing.  So this will take quite a bit longer than planned.  We'll need to look at various methods of automating the process.  Maybe we rename it to be the 'repology metadata' project.  It will still need to include implementation of the installation routines, but it probably wont have time to solve installation of every bear.  Perhaps it should focus only on linters managed via ruby bundler, and or npm.  That will avoid most conflicts with the other two projects.\n@yzgyyang , the first step is for you to create a new very basic proposal page for your project.","comments":8,"createdAt":"2018-04-24T20:57:14Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-03T08:24:58Z","closedAt":"2018-08-03T08:24:58Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"},{"name":"importance/critical","color":"b60205"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1534142636000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/573","number":573,"title":"Remove trailing underscore in pyflakes URL","body":"The pyflakes project link is\nhttp://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=integrate_pyflakes-enhanced_ast_into_coala_\nWithout the underscore it doesnt work.\nhttp://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=integrate_pyflakes-enhanced_ast_into_coala\nWe need both to work, and the former redirect to the latter.\nIt might be possible to use Netlify _redirects to do the redirect.","comments":7,"createdAt":"2018-05-12T05:51:53Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-13T06:43:56Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"srivama","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17855807?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"1d76db"},{"name":"importance/low","color":"2fe055"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1533568764000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/583","number":583,"title":".coafile: Set max line length for project pages","body":"Similar to coala/cEPs#134 , the project pages (i.e. pages in https://github.com/coala/projects/tree/master/_projects) should have a reasonable line length to improve the ability to read & code review them.\nc.f. coala/cEPs#157\nTry length 120 for existing files so it requires less disruptive changes to the existing files.\nThen add another section which requires 80 cpl and excludes the existing files.","comments":13,"createdAt":"2018-05-23T11:53:53Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-06T15:19:24Z","closedAt":"2018-08-06T15:19:24Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"Man-Jain","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12700384?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"difficulty/low","color":"1d76db"},{"name":"importance/high","color":"eb6420"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1533946333000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/589","number":589,"title":"Rule based ignores","body":"Currently coala can ignore rules based on in-source comments.\nThat can get very messy when particular rules sgould always be ignored in common but well defined scenarios.\nIn those case it is better to define a rule about the relevant lines.\nSee flake8-putty, which uses regex to describe scenarios.\nThe solution for this project should be more generic that flake8-putty, possibly using bears to define ranges when custom actions which ignore results.","comments":0,"createdAt":"2018-06-03T15:24:13Z","updatedAt":"2018-08-11T00:12:13Z","closedAt":null,"state":"open","user":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project Proposal","color":"f9d0c4"}]}},{"repoOwner":"coala","repoName":"projects","updatedAtMs":1533090142000,"issue":{"htmlUrl":"https://github.com/coala/projects/issues/590","number":590,"title":"Create new project proposal: IGitt scm support","body":"IGitt is a library to support multiple hosters.\ncoala bears for VCS currently do not use IGitt.

I am surprised that there are no forks which have modified this (c.f. #5), as that seems like a logical easy way to improve the front page (c.f. #3).\nIncluding configuration in the master branch causes forks to diverge.

New meta bear for analyzing commits","body":"This adds a new meta bear that returns HiddenResult\nof commit analysis for other bears to use.\n\nFor short term contributors: we understand that getting your commits well\ndefined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning. If you\nlook to help without wanting to contribute long term there's no need\nfor you to learn this. Just drop us a message and we'll take care of brushing\nup your stuff for merge!\nChecklist\n\n I read the commit guidelines and I've followed\nthem.\n I ran coala over my code locally. (All commits have to pass\nindividually. It is not sufficient to have \"fixup commits\" on your PR,\nour bot will still report the issues for the previous commit.) You will\nlikely receive a lot of bot comments and build failures if coala does not\npass on every single commit!\n\nAfter you submit your pull request, DO NOT click the 'Update Branch' button.\nWhen asked for a rebase, consult coala.io/rebase\ninstead.\nPlease consider helping us by reviewing other peoples pull requests as well:\n\npick up any PR at https://coala.io/review\nreview it (check https://coala.io/reviewing for more info)\nif you are sure that it needs work, use corobo mark wip <URL> to get it out\nof the review queue.\n\nThe more you review, the more your score will grow at

Improved I/O mechanism for coala.\n+   1. Added a class `FileFactory` to interface with files and to provide file\n+      contents in different forms like string, binary data or as a tuple.\n+   2. Added a `Directory` class to interface with directories and provide\n+      useful information about them such as the directory path, parent\n+      directory and timestamps. This will be later used to implement ignore\n+      directories functionality.\n+   3. Added documentation for `FileFactory` and improved the NextGen-Core\n+      docs.\n+\n+2. Caching support.\n+   1. Cached the properties of `FileFactory` which turned out to be a\n+      significant performance boost in consecutive coala runs.\n+   2. Added support for unordered collection types in `persistent_hash`\n+      which improved the NextGen-Core's ability to hash much more\n+      complex task objects (which are used in NextGen caching).\n+\n+3. Integrated `FileFactory` with the core.\n+   1. Added line endings support for `FileFactory`.\n+   2. Implemented a middleware `FileDict` that mimics a dictionary\n+      and provides the bears in the old core with the actual file\n+      contents instead of the `FileFactory` objects thereby maintaining\n+      backwards compatibility with the old core.\n+   3. Modified the tests to use actual files and the `FileFactory` objects\n+      instead of hard-coded file contents.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+One of the first challenges I faced was designing the `FileFactory`.\n+But with my mentors help we were able to come up with a design that\n+could be used for the NextGen-Core and also maintained compatibility\n+with the old core.\n+\n+The biggest challenge that I faced these three months for the integration\n+of the aforementioned `FileFactory` with the core. Initially about thirty\n+tests were failing but after discussing the idea of using a middleware\n+(`FileDict`) to maintain backwards compatibilty with the old core the test\n+failures were significantly reduced to just six. After a while I discovered\n+that `FileFactory` was somehow removing line-endings from the file contents\n+which was fixed by adding support for newlines in `FileFactory` which in turn\n+led to a successful integration.\n+\n+#### Work to be done\n+\n+Two major features were left out because of time constraints:\n+1. Ignore directories functionality for the NextGen-Core.\n+2. Cache control flags for the NextGen-Core (which was\n+   already mentioned as a stretch issue in my GSoC proposal).\n+\n+I have started the work on implementing the cache control flags and will","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[{"id":"MDg6UmVhY3Rpb24yNzgxNjUyMQ==","createdAt":"2018-08-13T06:22:36Z","content":"THUMBS_UP","user":{"login":"palash25","name":"Palash Nigam"}}],"createdAt":"2018-08-13T01:11:13Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-13T01:11:13Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTQ3NTU5Mw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/635#discussion_r209475593","bodyText":"missing ;-)","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,187 @@\n+---\n+categories:\n+  - GSoC\n+  - 2018\n+  - StatusReport\n+report_year: 2018\n+date: 2018-08-12\n+student: Palash Nigam\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link: https://coala.io\n+project: Optimize Caching for the NextGen-Core\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6434190552203264\n+tarball: ","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-13T01:11:27Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-13T01:11:27Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTUyNjI1OQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/635#discussion_r209526259","bodyText":"14 patches vs 15 activities.... ?","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,184 @@\n+---\n+categories:\n+  - GSoC\n+  - 2018\n+  - StatusReport\n+report_year: 2018\n+date: 2018-08-12\n+student: Palash Nigam\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link: https://coala.io\n+project: Optimize Caching for the NextGen-Core\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6434190552203264\n+tarball: https://rawgit.com/palash25/gsoc-18-report/master/project.tar.gz\n+sha256sum: 0af1551d96663f82c5ccf05437008ba00fade628a5a1659bdb78364b3546caf4\n+mentors: >\n+  [Mischa Krüger](https://github.com/Makman2),\n+  [Shreyans Doshi](https://github.com/shreyans800755),\n+  [Fabian Neuschmidt](https://github.com/fneu)\n+phase:\n+  - Bonding: https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/32\n+  - Phase 1: https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/33\n+  - Phase 2: https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/34\n+  - Phase 3: https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/35\n+bio: >\n+  I am second year student of B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering at\n+  International Institute of Information and Technology, Bhubaneswar,\n+  Odisha, India.

I also implemented a assign request plugin to assign\n+ issues to a user if he/she satisfies defined eligibilty conditions.\n+social:\n+ - GitHub:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://github.com/Vamshi99\n+ - GitLab:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/Vamshi99\n+ - Gitter:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitter.im/Vamshi99\n+email: bommvams72@gmail.com\n+blog: https://vamshi99.blogspot.com\n+activity:\n+ - 0:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/225a88e695794535f50996b4997466b72e9d47ea\n+   - details: >\n+      Add gitmate pr rejector plugin\n+ - 2:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/847afeb5460ce2866ecb2cc38593c0c486aa0271\n+   - details: >\n+      Commit.py: Add mentioned_issues, closes_issues propeties\n+ - 3:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/05062b4f9758068291445f87469e4d9d2a4f9707\n+   - details: >\n+      Upgrade IGitt\n+ - 4:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/3d2164d71722e55a6432a8911149c64897851564\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Fixes vs Closes automated checking plugin\n+ - 5:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/4a044453f5d34c9f1b8227b7f57b8a0fd0caba57\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest.py: Add fix_issues, close_issues, resolve_issues properties\n+ - 6:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ffd554de617d619809f11b0284eaa032c2d9df83\n+   - details: >\n+      Auto assign issue based on commit mention in PR\n+ - 7:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/0eec2ec32e7afd7d017cad4c67a741c688e1bfc4\n+   - details: >\n+      apps.py: Add helper function to fetch plugin settings\n+ - 8:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/e2224d7d1f61a34065f741535e53e676dc51ff4b\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Team class\n+ - 9:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/f9d08c9a88c0b958a4c2ec5eb813fcd124b5300e\n+   - details: >\n+      Mark PR as WIP if coala plugin detects errors\n+ - 10:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c4abdd4f9367af8ce73f39f525383def68de6b62\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest: Add mergeable property\n+ - 11:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/db76142d3ecb1e6cd9cd10885ae2475cb07c4d3d\n+   - details: >\n+      Notify merge conflicts in a PR\n+ - 12:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ad5480c9b0a124d98020a4ad3fd3caf20fa1e321\n+   - details: >\n+      pr_rejector: Support regex in branch names\n+ - 13:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/94735ff0f1024d6f293db90516087d8e4d2c353d\n+   - details: >\n+      Organization: Add issues property and filter_issues method\n+ - 14:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/fff0d568f1f2731c5055995ff19bbc93be842d5f\n+   - details: >\n+      Repository: Filter issues by label, assignee\n+ - 15:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c025311167b07da5e825433a4d4d5e376adfed62\n+   - details: >\n+      GitLabUser: Fetch user id from username\n+ - 16:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/fad8305823a1058e93cd2397b5239a882b66c3f9\n+   - details: >\n+      Add squash pull request command\n+ - 17:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/3124c07ca5cd46acf985dc25fe22889e5a4744d0\n+   - details: >\n+      Dockerfile: Install requirements\n+ - 18:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/68360f3f0fac686907c7eb44c1a70bfa9e276d42\n+   - details: >\n+      run.py: Update squash command\n+ - 19:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/dda98a8ab67d01376d3199bb82260838cebab7b0\n+   - details: >\n+      rebaser: Add squash command\n+---\n+\n+### Implement Gitmate automations and plugins for coala\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+1.

I also implemented a assign request plugin to assign\n+ issues to a user if he/she satisfies defined eligibilty conditions.\n+social:\n+ - GitHub:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://github.com/Vamshi99\n+ - GitLab:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/Vamshi99\n+ - Gitter:\n+   - username: Vamshi99\n+   - link: https://gitter.im/Vamshi99\n+email: bommvams72@gmail.com\n+blog: https://vamshi99.blogspot.com\n+activity:\n+ - 0:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/225a88e695794535f50996b4997466b72e9d47ea\n+   - details: >\n+      Add gitmate pr rejector plugin\n+ - 2:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/847afeb5460ce2866ecb2cc38593c0c486aa0271\n+   - details: >\n+      Commit.py: Add mentioned_issues, closes_issues propeties\n+ - 3:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/05062b4f9758068291445f87469e4d9d2a4f9707\n+   - details: >\n+      Upgrade IGitt\n+ - 4:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/3d2164d71722e55a6432a8911149c64897851564\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Fixes vs Closes automated checking plugin\n+ - 5:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/4a044453f5d34c9f1b8227b7f57b8a0fd0caba57\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest.py: Add fix_issues, close_issues, resolve_issues properties\n+ - 6:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ffd554de617d619809f11b0284eaa032c2d9df83\n+   - details: >\n+      Auto assign issue based on commit mention in PR\n+ - 7:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/0eec2ec32e7afd7d017cad4c67a741c688e1bfc4\n+   - details: >\n+      apps.py: Add helper function to fetch plugin settings\n+ - 8:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/e2224d7d1f61a34065f741535e53e676dc51ff4b\n+   - details: >\n+      Add Team class\n+ - 9:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/f9d08c9a88c0b958a4c2ec5eb813fcd124b5300e\n+   - details: >\n+      Mark PR as WIP if coala plugin detects errors\n+ - 10:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c4abdd4f9367af8ce73f39f525383def68de6b62\n+   - details: >\n+      MergeRequest: Add mergeable property\n+ - 11:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/db76142d3ecb1e6cd9cd10885ae2475cb07c4d3d\n+   - details: >\n+      Notify merge conflicts in a PR\n+ - 12:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/ad5480c9b0a124d98020a4ad3fd3caf20fa1e321\n+   - details: >\n+      pr_rejector: Support regex in branch names\n+ - 13:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/94735ff0f1024d6f293db90516087d8e4d2c353d\n+   - details: >\n+      Organization: Add issues property and filter_issues method\n+ - 14:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/fff0d568f1f2731c5055995ff19bbc93be842d5f\n+   - details: >\n+      Repository: Filter issues by label, assignee\n+ - 15:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/c025311167b07da5e825433a4d4d5e376adfed62\n+   - details: >\n+      GitLabUser: Fetch user id from username\n+ - 16:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/fad8305823a1058e93cd2397b5239a882b66c3f9\n+   - details: >\n+      Add squash pull request command\n+ - 17:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/3124c07ca5cd46acf985dc25fe22889e5a4744d0\n+   - details: >\n+      Dockerfile: Install requirements\n+ - 18:\n+   - repo: mr-rebaser\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/mr-rebaser/commit/68360f3f0fac686907c7eb44c1a70bfa9e276d42\n+   - details: >\n+      run.py: Update squash command\n+ - 19:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/commit/dda98a8ab67d01376d3199bb82260838cebab7b0\n+   - details: >\n+      rebaser: Add squash command\n+ - 20:\n+   - repo: IGitt\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/commit/f4ec3c602745bcf08405479a684876cc1080a21f\n+   - details: >\n+      Issue: Add available_assignees property\n+ - 21:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/merge_requests/525\n+   - details: >\n+      Add assign request command\n+ - 22:\n+   - repo: gitmate-2\n+   - link: https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2/merge_requests/524\n+   - details: >\n+      Add review plugin\n+---\n+\n+### Implement Gitmate automations and plugins for coala\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+1.

Pdb's quit-command (`q`) remapped so coala continues its normal execution\n+      without aborting. So, `quit` or `q` will first clear all breakpoints and\n+      then continue execution.\n+   3. Users can specify the bear they want to debug using `--debug-bears`.\n+   4. Users can specify to debug bears using a `.coafile`.\n+\n+2.

Debugger Interface added in coala.\n+   1. Step into the `run()` method of a bear move through it using a debugger\n+      interface such as `pdb` and exits as soon as `run()` is left.\n+   2. Pdb's quit-command (`q`) remapped so coala continues its normal execution\n+      without aborting. So, `quit` or `q` will first clear all breakpoints and\n+      then continue execution.\n+   3. Users can specify the bear they want to debug using `--debug-bears`.\n+   4. Users can specify to debug bears using a `.coafile`.\n+\n+2. A new command `settings` is included in coala's Debugging Interface to\n+   inspect Bear settings in the debugging environment. It displays all passed\n+   settings of a Bear and their values so bear developer can quickly inspect\n+   them.\n+\n+3. Profiler Interface added in coala.\n+   1. The profiler will start by profiling the `run()` method of bears because\n+      this is the part where bear writers will spend time on, as rest of the\n+      part like loading the files, collecting the settings, etc. are done by\n+      coala itself.\n+   2. `--profile-bears` or `profile_bears` (using .coafile) is the main argument\n+      to enable profiling.\n+   3. Accept an additional parameter `directory_path` through which bear\n+      developers can specify where to store the profiled data files.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+I had difficulties with testing of Debugger interface. With the help of `Mock`,\n+test for debugger interface was created, though code coverage was 100% but\n+`mock` test was not the ideal test, so after hours of discussion with Mischa we\n+decided to capture the `pdb stdout` and assert the the output with the real\n+output but problem arised, the ideal tests passes but somehow it didn't showed\n+the code coverage to 100% not only that it was also removing the coverage of\n+the previous tests, at first I thought created test have some problem but seems\n+like `pytest-cov` had a problem, so to confirm that I created a\n+[test repo](https://github.com/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) and enable the\n+[CI](https://travis-ci.org/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) on that repo to check the\n+coverage response, it also showed same failure. So, we first created a issue on\n+`pytest-cov` repo, but actual problem was both coverage and debugger use the\n+same trace feature, so it was not possible to run coverage and debugger in\n+parallel or say it is not possible to chain the trace functions, so Mischa gave\n+a idea to restore the trace callbacks and then run test and finally it worked\n+so I included both ideal and `Mock` test so that the coverage remain 100, but\n+in all of these I lagged 3-4 week from my schedule.

Debugger Interface added in coala.\n+   1. Step into the `run()` method of a bear move through it using a debugger\n+      interface such as `pdb` and exits as soon as `run()` is left.\n+   2. Pdb's quit-command (`q`) remapped so coala continues its normal execution\n+      without aborting. So, `quit` or `q` will first clear all breakpoints and\n+      then continue execution.\n+   3. Users can specify the bear they want to debug using `--debug-bears`.\n+   4. Users can specify to debug bears using a `.coafile`.\n+\n+2. A new command `settings` is included in coala's Debugging Interface to\n+   inspect Bear settings in the debugging environment. It displays all passed\n+   settings of a Bear and their values so bear developer can quickly inspect\n+   them.\n+\n+3. Profiler Interface added in coala.\n+   1. The profiler will start by profiling the `run()` method of bears because\n+      this is the part where bear writers will spend time on, as rest of the\n+      part like loading the files, collecting the settings, etc. are done by\n+      coala itself.\n+   2. `--profile-bears` or `profile_bears` (using .coafile) is the main argument\n+      to enable profiling.\n+   3. Accept an additional parameter `directory_path` through which bear\n+      developers can specify where to store the profiled data files.\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+I had difficulties with testing of Debugger interface. With the help of `Mock`,\n+test for debugger interface was created, though code coverage was 100% but\n+`mock` test was not the ideal test, so after hours of discussion with Mischa we\n+decided to capture the `pdb stdout` and assert the the output with the real\n+output but problem arised, the ideal tests passes but somehow it didn't showed\n+the code coverage to 100% not only that it also removed the coverage of the\n+previous tests, at first I thought created test have some problem but seems\n+like `pytest-cov` had a problem, so to confirm that I created a\n+[test repo](https://github.com/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) and enable the\n+[CI](https://travis-ci.org/RaiVaibhav/test_repo) on that repo to check the\n+coverage report, it also showed same failure. So, I created a issue on\n+`pytest-cov` repo but actual problem was, both coverage and debugger use the\n+same trace feature, so it was not possible to run coverage and debugger in\n+parallel or say it is not possible to chain the trace functions, so Mischa gave\n+a idea to restore the trace callbacks and then run test, it worked finally so I\n+included both ideal and `Mock` test so that the coverage remain 100, but in all\n+of these I lagged around 3 week from my schedule. So I couldn't implement one of\n+the proposed feature.\n+\n+#### Work to be done\n+\n+A tool which will provide the ability to inspect result instances like\n+`origin`, `diffs`, `file`, `severity`, `message`, `aspects` and several other\n+attributes in debugging environment or in a seperate python console where all\n+where user can easily access there values.

Thus, the full potential of\n+enhanced AST isn't utilized, a whole lot of rework is required to do\n+the basic traversing and collection of important nodes. Pyflakes provides\n+with a basic API that does the traversing. So, if a developer uses enhanced\n+AST he just needs to work on the implementation of the new logic that his/her\n+plugin provides and not about the fidelity of the basic node handlers.\n+\n+**Major tasks of the project:**\n+\n+1. Create a separate repository `coala-pyflakes` to house all\n+   pyflakes based plugins.\n+2. Create package `pyflakes_bears` to hold `PyFlakesASTBear` and all the\n+   coala bears developed using it.\n+3. Create package `pyflakes_generic_plugins` that consists generic plugins\n+   which can be integrated with `flake8` and other such similar wrappers.\n+4. Design and develop `PyFlakesASTBear` that provides helper functions\n+   that can be used to traverse pyflakes AST of the input python module.\n+5. Establish the proof of concept by creating `NoFutureImportBear` that\n+   detects and fixes any usage of `__future__` imports in a python file.\n+6. Add handlers for `ARGS` and `ARGUMENTS` and provide the functionality\n+   of partial code analysis in `pyflakes`.\n+7. Create a `PEP8NamingBear` that detects all pep8 naming violations\n+   in a python file. Special handling is also done to detect violations\n+   in doctests which other similar plugins fail to perform.\n+8. Create a `BuiltinsBear` that is capable of detecting redefinition\n+   of python builtins in a file.","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-08-09T15:36:13Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-09T15:36:13Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwODk3ODUwMQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/614#discussion_r208978501","bodyText":"\"ready\" isnt clear.

Thus, the full potential of\n+enhanced AST isn't utilized, a whole lot of rework is required to do\n+the basic traversing and collection of important nodes. Pyflakes provides\n+with a basic API that does the traversing. So, if a developer uses enhanced\n+AST he just needs to work on the implementation of the new logic that his/her\n+plugin provides and not about the fidelity of the basic node handlers.\n+\n+**Major tasks of the project:**\n+\n+1. Create a separate repository `coala-pyflakes` to house all\n+   pyflakes based plugins.\n+2. Create package `pyflakes_bears` to hold `PyFlakesASTBear` and all the\n+   coala bears developed using it.\n+3. Create package `pyflakes_generic_plugins` that consists generic plugins\n+   which can be integrated with `flake8` and other such similar wrappers.\n+4. Design and develop `PyFlakesASTBear` that provides helper functions\n+   that can be used to traverse pyflakes AST of the input python module.\n+5. Establish the proof of concept by creating `NoFutureImportBear` that\n+   detects and fixes any usage of `__future__` imports in a python file.\n+6. Add handlers for `ARGS` and `ARGUMENTS` and provide the functionality\n+   of partial code analysis in `pyflakes`.\n+7. Create a `PEP8NamingBear` that detects all pep8 naming violations\n+   in a python file. Special handling is also done to detect violations\n+   in doctests which other similar plugins fail to perform.\n+8. Create a `BuiltinsBear` that is capable of detecting redefinition\n+   of python builtins in a file.\n+\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+The challenge of the project was to implement the `PyFlakesASTBear` in\n+such a way that a plugin developer need not worry about writing his own\n+traversing logic and need to have much no more than the knowledge of\n+PyFlakesASTBear nodes to write the bears. However, designing the logic\n+first by writing cEP(coala enhancement proposal) for\n+[coala-pyflakes](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0025.md) helped\n+me a lot to understand the problem to a deep level and come out with a logic\n+to tackle it.\n+\n+#### Future prospects of the projects\n+\n+With `PyFlakesASTBear` ready bear developers can use it to detect codesmells","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"createdAt":"2018-08-09T15:37:50Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-09T15:37:50Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTAyMjkzMw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/614#discussion_r209022933","bodyText":"Use quotes or : will be treated as defining yaml variable","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,305 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/macbox7\n+student: Ankit Joshi\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link: https://coala.io\n+project: Integrate pyflakes-enhanced AST into coala\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5549789140221952\n+tarball: https://rawgit.com/MacBox7/GSoC-Report/master/project.tar.gz\n+mentors: >\n+ [John Vandenberg](https://github.com/jayvdb) & [Adhika Setya Pramudita](https://github.com/adhikasp) & [Steven Myint](https://github.com/myint)\n+\n+phase:\n+ - Bonding : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/8\n+ - Phase 1 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/25\n+ - Phase 2 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/26\n+ - Phase 3 : https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/27\n+\n+bio: >\n+  A senior student at National Institute Of Technology, Kurukshetra major\n+  in Information Technology.

details: >\n+     Generate a fake api similar to coala's webservices\n+\n+### Newcomer Metrics and Gamification\n+\n+This project is about automating the recognition of activities performed by people\n+who join the coala community, and encourage them to progress towards obtaining the\n+role of \"Developer\" in the community.\n+\n+This project incorporated a gamification system which allows us to track the progress\n+of newcomers activities and assign some points to each of the activities they do.\n+The newcomers will get some score which will be the sum of all the points they have\n+earned by performing several activities. The score they get will be a deciding factor\n+for the current 'Level' of the newcomer and the activities they perform will be a\n+deciding factor for 'Badges' they have earned.\n+\n+coala always tries to be a welcoming organization for newcomers, giving them clear\n+pathways and as much direct assistance as possible. However, it is already known that\n+newcomers face many barriers while attempting to contribute to open source for the\n+first time, and additional barriers while attempting to contribute to projects run\n+by the coala organization. On the other hand, gamification is widely used to engage\n+and motivate people to accomplish tasks and improve their performance.\n+\n+Thus, the goal of this project is to use gamification to orient and motivate newcomers\n+to overcome onboarding barriers to contribute and engage with coala and its community.\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+##### Creating the APIs\n+\n+To build the gamification app, there was a need of constant data supply of all the\n+activities newcomers do, i.e. Getting a pull request merge, Creating an issue and\n+sending messages to the gitter channels. The work to achieve the same has been done\n+in the [webservices](https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/) repo.

details: >\n+     Generate a fake api similar to coala's webservices\n+\n+### Newcomer Metrics and Gamification\n+\n+This project is about automating the recognition of activities performed by people\n+who join the coala community, and encourage them to progress towards obtaining the\n+role of \"Developer\" in the community.\n+\n+This project incorporated a gamification system which allows us to track the progress\n+of newcomers activities and assign some points to each of the activities they do.\n+The newcomers will get some score which will be the sum of all the points they have\n+earned by performing several activities. The score they get will be a deciding factor\n+for the current 'Level' of the newcomer and the activities they perform will be a\n+deciding factor for 'Badges' they have earned.\n+\n+coala always tries to be a welcoming organization for newcomers, giving them clear\n+pathways and as much direct assistance as possible. However, it is already known that\n+newcomers face many barriers while attempting to contribute to open source for the\n+first time, and additional barriers while attempting to contribute to projects run\n+by the coala organization. On the other hand, gamification is widely used to engage\n+and motivate people to accomplish tasks and improve their performance.\n+\n+Thus, the goal of this project is to use gamification to orient and motivate newcomers\n+to overcome onboarding barriers to contribute and engage with coala and its community.\n+\n+#### Work Done\n+\n+##### Creating the APIs\n+\n+To build the gamification app, there was a need of constant data supply of all the\n+activities newcomers do, i.e. Getting a pull request merge, Creating an issue and\n+sending messages to the gitter channels. The work to achieve the same has been done\n+in the [webservices](https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/) repo. And the output of all\n+the script can be viewed at [webservices.coala.io](https://github.com/sks444/webservices.coala.io/commit/9d263725092f2ab18fde84fb46dececc95d2a76d) which is a workaround to get a fixed\n+URL for all the APIs until there is the integration of continuous deployment in the webservices.\n+\n+##### Building the Gamification system\n+\n+The second and the important part of my work, from [importing the useful newcomers data](https://github.com/coala/community/commit/537602ecbe67263a1c3a877f88444ec6620190f4)","author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-08-11T11:12:29Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-08-11T11:12:29Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwOTQyNDI4Mw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/619#discussion_r209424283","bodyText":"80cpl","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,246 @@\n+---\n+layout: report\n+permalink: /GSoC/2018/StatusReport/ShrikrishnaSingh\n+student: Shrikrishna Singh\n+organisation: coala\n+organisation_link : https://coala.io\n+project: Newcomer metrics and gamification\n+project_link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5892040252981248\n+tarball: https://github.com/sks444/GSoC-18-Patches/raw/master/project.tar.gz\n+mentors: >\n+ [John Vandenberg](http://github.com/jayvdb),\n+ [Pranav Dixit](https://github.com/prnvdixit),\n+ [Andrew Dassonville](https://github.com/andrewda) &\n+ [Gopala](https://github.com/gkrishnan724)\n+phase:\n+ - Bonding : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/2>\n+ - Phase 1 : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/19>\n+ - Phase 2 : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/43>\n+ - Phase 3 : <https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2018/milestones/44>\n+bio: >\n+ I am a final year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at\n+ Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.

../outside_committers/, .../outside_projects/, ../portfolio_projects, one by one, to verify that there is not any problem in any of the views, and the netlify passes when any of them is removed.\n\n/model/openhub/portfolio_projects/ is prettier than /openhub/ , so I would prefer removing the latter.\n\nAt /openhub/ we are deploying only one page and at
